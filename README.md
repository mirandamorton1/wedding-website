  ## Description
  This project was created to help wedding guests get detailed information about an upcoming wedding. Users are able to RSVP for the wedding by looking up their invitations and accepting or declining. Users are also able to look up the local weather on the "Travel" page as well as book hotel rooms. Additionally, guests can view details such as time, place, attire, wedding party, and general information about the bride and groom as well as photos.
